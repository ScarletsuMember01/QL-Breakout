# QL-Breakout

Machine Learning Project using Reinforcement Learning (QL) Algorithm
It tries to break all the blocks without touching the black one 

# Prerequisite

I am using Visual Studio 2022 & the project is created using CLR
So make sure to use it (or otherwise i don't know if it will work)
The project is not using any library or import so nothing else to do
